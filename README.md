# WordClass

Making programming with WordPress easier and more fun.

I created this, because I got confused with a number of WordPress functions, that either look too similar, have an unreasonable amount of parameters, or are unnecessarily difficult to work with. And I didn't want to always search for the names of hooks.

## Installation

WordClass requires PHP 8 and can be installed with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):
```
composer require nerbiz/wordclass
```

## Usage

You can find usage examples in the [example files](https://github.com/nerbiz/wordclass/tree/master/example), most notably the [functions.php](https://github.com/nerbiz/wordclass/blob/master/example/functions.php) file.

Read the [wiki pages](https://github.com/nerbiz/wordclass/wiki) for more information.

## Contributing

If you have some ideas about expanding or improving this project, I'm open for suggestions and pull requests.
